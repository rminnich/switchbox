 *  vmx.c - The Intel VT-x driver for Dune

 *
 * This modified version is simpler because it avoids the following
 * features that are not requirements for Dune:
 *  * Real-mode emulation
 *  * Nested VT-x support
 *  * I/O hardware emulation
 *  * Any of the more esoteric X86 features and registers
 *  * KVM-specific functionality
 *
 * In essence we provide only the minimum functionality needed to run
 * a process in vmx non-root mode rather than the full hardware emulation
 * needed to support an entire OS.
 *
 * This driver is a research prototype and as such has the following
 * limitations:
 *
 * FIXME: Backward compatibility is currently a non-goal, and only recent
 * full-featured (EPT, PCID, VPID, etc.) Intel hardware is supported by this
 * driver.
 *
 * FIXME: Eventually we should handle concurrent user's of VT-x more
 * gracefully instead of requiring exclusive access. This would allow
 * Dune to interoperate with KVM and other HV solutions.
 *
 * FIXME: We need to support hotplugged physical CPUs.

/* Basic flow.
 * Yep, it's confusing. This is in part because the vmcs is used twice, for two different things.
 * You're left with the feeling that they got part way through and realized they had to have one for
 *
 * 1) your CPU is going to be capable of running VMs, and you need state for that.
 *
 * 2) you're about to start a guest, and you need state for that.
 *
 * So there is get cpu set up to be able to run VMs stuff, and now
 * let's start a guest stuff.  In Akaros, CPUs will always be set up
 * to run a VM if that is possible. Processes can flip themselves into
 * a VM and that will require another VMCS.
 *
 * So: at kernel startup time, the SMP boot stuff calls
 * k/a/x86/vmm/vmm.c:vmm_init, which calls arch-dependent bits, which
 * in the case of this file is intel_vmm_init. That does some code
 * that sets up stuff for ALL sockets, based on the capabilities of
 * the socket it runs on. If any cpu supports vmx, it assumes they all
 * do. That's a realistic assumption. So the call_function_all is kind
 * of stupid, really; it could just see what's on the current cpu and
 * assume it's on all. HOWEVER: there are systems in the wild that
 * can run VMs on some but not all CPUs, due to BIOS mistakes, so we
 * might as well allow for the chance that we'll only all VMMCPs on a
 * subset (not implemented yet however).  So: probe all CPUs, get a
 * count of how many support VMX and, for now, assume they all do
 * anyway.
 *
 * Next, call setup_vmcs_config to configure the GLOBAL vmcs_config struct,
 * which contains all the naughty bits settings for all the cpus that can run a VM.
 * Realistically, all VMX-capable cpus in a system will have identical configurations.
 * So: 0 or more cpus can run VMX; all cpus which can run VMX will have the same configuration.
 *
 * configure the msr_bitmap. This is the bitmap of MSRs which the
 * guest can manipulate.  Currently, we only allow GS and FS base.
 *
 * Reserve bit 0 in the vpid bitmap as guests can not use that
 *
 * Set up the what we call the vmxarea. The vmxarea is per-cpu, not
 * per-guest. Once set up, it is left alone.  The ONLY think we set in
 * there is the revision area. The VMX is page-sized per cpu and
 * page-aligned. Note that it can be smaller, but why bother? We know
 * the max size and alignment, and it's convenient.
 *
 * Now that it is set up, enable vmx on all cpus. This involves
 * testing VMXE in cr4, to see if we've been here before (TODO: delete
 * this test), then testing MSR_IA32_FEATURE_CONTROL to see if we can
 * do a VM, the setting the VMXE in cr4, calling vmxon (does a vmxon
 * instruction), and syncing vpid's and ept's.  Now the CPU is ready
 * to host guests.
 *
 * Setting up a guest.
 * We divide this into two things: vmm_proc_init and vm_run.
 * Currently, on Intel, vmm_proc_init does nothing.
 *
 * vm_run is really complicated. It is called with a coreid, and
 * vmctl struct. On intel, it calls vmx_launch. vmx_launch is set
 * up for a few test cases. If rip is 1, it sets the guest rip to
 * a function which will deref 0 and should exit with failure 2. If rip is 0,
 * it calls an infinite loop in the guest.
 *
 * The sequence of operations:
 * create a vcpu
 * while (1) {
 * get a vcpu
 * disable irqs (required or you can't enter the VM)
 * vmx_run_vcpu()
 * enable irqs
 * manage the vm exit
 * }
 *
 * get a vcpu
 * See if the current cpu has a vcpu. If so, and is the same as the vcpu we want,
 * vmcs_load(vcpu->vmcs) -- i.e. issue a VMPTRLD.
 *
 * If it's not the same, see if the vcpu thinks it is on the core. If it is not, call
 * __vmx_get_cpu_helper on the other cpu, to free it up. Else vmcs_clear the one
 * attached to this cpu. Then vmcs_load the vmcs for vcpu on this this cpu,
 * call __vmx_setup_cpu, mark this vcpu as being attached to this cpu, done.
 *
 * vmx_run_vcpu this one gets messy, mainly because it's a giant wad
 * of inline assembly with embedded CPP crap. I suspect we'll want to
 * un-inline it someday, but maybe not.  It's called with a vcpu
 * struct from which it loads guest state, and to which it stores
 * non-virtualized host state. It issues a vmlaunch or vmresume
 * instruction depending, and on return, it evaluates if things the
 * launch/resume had an error in that operation. Note this is NOT the
 * same as an error while in the virtual machine; this is an error in
 * startup due to misconfiguration. Depending on what is returned it's
 * either a failed vm startup or an exit for lots of many reasons.
 *

/*
 * A note on Things You Can't Make Up.
 * or
 * "George, you can type this shit, but you can't say it" -- Harrison Ford
 *
 * There are 5 VMCS 32-bit words that control guest permissions. If
 * you set these correctly, you've got a guest that will behave. If
 * you get even one bit wrong, you've got a guest that will chew your
 * leg off. Some bits must be 1, some must be 0, and some can be set
 * either way. To add to the fun, the docs are sort of a docudrama or,
 * as the quote goes, "interesting if true."
 *
 * To determine what bit can be set in what VMCS 32-bit control word,
 * there are 5 corresponding 64-bit MSRs.  And, to make it even more
 * fun, the standard set of MSRs have errors in them, i.e. report
 * incorrect values, for legacy reasons, and so you are supposed to
 * "look around" to another set, which have correct bits in
 * them. There are four such 'correct' registers, and they have _TRUE_
 * in the names as you can see below. We test for the value of VMCS
 * control bits in the _TRUE_ registers if possible. The fifth
 * register, CPU Secondary Exec Controls, which came later, needs no
 * _TRUE_ variant.
 *
 * For each MSR, the high 32 bits tell you what bits can be "1" by a
 * "1" in that position; the low 32 bits tell you what bit can be "0"
 * by a "0" in that position. So, for each of 32 bits in a given VMCS
 * control word, there is a pair of bits in an MSR that tells you what
 * values it can take. The two bits, of which there are *four*
 * combinations, describe the *three* possible operations on a
 * bit. The two bits, taken together, form an untruth table: There are
 * three possibilities: The VMCS bit can be set to 0 or 1, or it can
 * only be 0, or only 1. The fourth combination is not supposed to
 * happen.
 *
 * So: there is the 1 bit from the upper 32 bits of the msr.
 * If this bit is set, then the bit can be 1. If clear, it can not be 1.
 *
 * Then there is the 0 bit, from low 32 bits. If clear, the VMCS bit
 * can be 0. If 1, the VMCS bit can not be 0.
 *
 * SO, let's call the 1 bit R1, and the 0 bit R0, we have:
 *  R1 R0
 *  0 0 -> must be 0
 *  1 0 -> can be 1, can be 0
 *  0 1 -> can not be 1, can not be 0. --> JACKPOT! Not seen yet.
 *  1 1 -> must be one.
 *
 * It's also pretty hard to know what you can and can't set, and
 * that's led to inadvertent opening of permissions at times.  Because
 * of this complexity we've decided on the following: the driver must
 * define EVERY bit, UNIQUELY, for each of the 5 registers, that it wants
 * set. Further, for any bit that's settable, the driver must specify
 * a setting; for any bit that's reserved, the driver settings must
 * match that bit. If there are reserved bits we don't specify, that's
 * ok; we'll take them as is.
 *
 * We use a set-means-set, and set-means-clear model, i.e. we use a
 * 32-bit word to contain the bits we want to be 1, indicated by one;
 * and another 32-bit word in which a bit we want to be 0 is indicated
 * by a 1. This allows us to easily create masks of all bits we're
 * going to set, for example.
 *
 * We have two 32-bit numbers for each 32-bit VMCS field: bits we want
 * set and bits we want clear.  If you read the MSR for that field,
 * compute the reserved 0 and 1 settings, and | them together, they
 * need to result in 0xffffffff. You can see that we can create other
 * tests for conflicts (i.e. overlap).
 *
 * At this point, I've tested check_vmx_controls in every way
 * possible, because I kept screwing the bitfields up. You'll get a nice
 * error it won't work at all, which is what we want: a
 * failure-prone setup, where even errors that might result in correct
 * values are caught -- "right answer, wrong method, zero credit." If there's
 * weirdness in the bits, we don't want to run.
 * The try_set stuff adds particular ugliness but we have to have it.
